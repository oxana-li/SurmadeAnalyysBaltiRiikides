# Surmade Analüüs Balti riikides 1981-2020 / Analysis of deaths in the Baltic countries 1981-2020

The aim of the project is to study the mortality of people in different Baltic countries using different influencing factors and understand how big the difference is between the three neighboring countries.

Research questions have been established for the project:
1. What is the average number of deaths for women and men at a given age?
2. What is the relationship between age and mortality in different Baltic countries?
3. How did the data change over the years?
4. Has the mortality rate increased or decreased over time?
